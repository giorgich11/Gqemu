GQEMU README

What is it?
GQEMU is a lightweight Bash script that provides a Zenity GUI for QEMU. It’s designed to help you launch Virtual Machines quickly by selecting options through a menu instead of typing long, complex commands in the terminal.

Features

    ISO Selection: A simple file browser to pick your operating system image.

    VGA Profiles: Pick the right video driver for your setup:

        Virtio: Best performance for modern Linux.

        Std: Standard VGA, the most compatible for any OS.

        VirtualBox: Optimized compatibility settings for specific guest OS needs.

    RAM Management: Select exactly how much memory (1GB, 2GB, 4GB, etc.) to give the VM.

    Script-Based: It’s a transparent .sh file, so you can see exactly how the QEMU command is being built.

How to Install Zenity and QEMU
Before running the script, make sure you have the necessary tools installed for your Linux distribution:

Ubuntu, Debian, or Mint:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install qemu-system-x86 zenity -y

Fedora:
sudo dnf install qemu-system-x86 zenity

Arch Linux:
sudo pacman -S qemu-desktop zenity

How to use GQEMU

    Download the gqemu.sh file.

    Open your terminal in the folder where the file is.

    Make it executable: chmod +x gqemu.sh

    Run it: ./gqemu.sh

How it works

    The script uses Zenity to ask you for the location of your ISO file.

    You choose the VGA type (Virtio, Std, or VirtualBox) from a list.

    You select the amount of RAM for the Virtual Machine.

    The script combines these into a single command and starts QEMU for you.

Pro Hack
To make GQEMU a permanent tool on your system, move it to your local bin:
sudo cp gqemu.sh /usr/local/bin/gqemu && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gqemu
